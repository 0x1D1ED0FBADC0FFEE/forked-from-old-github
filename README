I have lost access to this github since it was registered under my student email account, and I still have to contact them to see if I can get my email account back. So I had to fork it. 

A repository presenting some projects to a prospective employer.

A brief summary of the projects by folder name:

LEADERSHIP AND SECURITY:

A tool, written in python, to turn passwords into human memorizable phrases that are theoretically easier to remember.

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING:

Written in Java, an interpreter for the functional programming language Lisp.

SQL:

A basic, real-world setup mimicking implementation of business logic in SQL, has queries, procedures and triggers. Produced from an ER diagram and a relational schema.

MACHINE LEARNING:

An auto-encoder for a certain set of recorded spoken digits (currently only 'zero'). Will take an audio file as input, encode it to a much smaller size,
and then the decoder will be able to produce an audible representation of the zero, from the encoded word. Uses Mel Spectrograms as the encode-decode basis. 

NETWORKING:

A star-of-stars network that instantiates clients and servers to send and receive data frames on a local network.
